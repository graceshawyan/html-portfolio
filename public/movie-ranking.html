<p>So many plot twists! This was definitely the best historical costume drama I watched, with an intriguing time-travel theme and incredible martial fight scenes. The sets and costumes are excellent, and it's pacing and comedy are top notch.</p>

<p>I read the original Webtoon, so it was interesting to see the TV adaptation. It's an incredibly thrilling film that explores the depths of human nature. I love that this apocalyptic film made me think about what it means to be human.</p>

<p>An interesting anime I watched the summer before college. The humor is fantastic, and it's exciting to see the main character achieve his dream of becoming a defense force officer.</p>
<p>"Nervousness. Panic. I’m feeling all kinds of pressure. But for some reason… I’m also incredibly excited! – Kafka"</p>
